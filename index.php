            <p>That's it! You're free!! Maybe take the time to play a game <em>other</em> than Overwatch, or catch up on your <a href="https://www.soundcloud.com/weeklyuprising" target="_blank">favorite podcast</a>.
            	<br /><br />
            Either way, congratulations! You've just retired from the Overwatch League.

              <p>Because the end of the season is drawing near, and you never know who will or won't survive the "Hukening" (at least on Boston), I created this helpful tool for players who needed a little help expressing themselves. /s<br /><br />OW Retirement Machine was started as a joke after one of the hosts of the <a href="https://www.twitter.com/weeklyuprising" target="_blank">Weekly Uprising Podcast</a> commented that players use the word "retire" somewhat casually in esports compared to traditional sports.  I hope it gave you a laugh, and if you like this kind of thing, check out the <a href="https://www.soundcloud.com/weeklyuprising" target="_blank">podcast</a>!<br /><span style="text-align: right;">-<em>Snowy</em></span><br /><br />Oh! And the name is obviously a reference to <a href="http://owplayoffmachine.com/" target="_blank">OW Playoff Machine</a>, a great website that lets you know just how early your team has been eliminated from playoff contention :)</p>
